This is a keymap for a Pro Micro based ADB to USB convertor to the Apple Extended Keyboard.

# USAGE

Pressing the top right key will switch to and from stock mode.

## Stock Mode

The keyboard starts in stock mode. In stock mode, no special qmk features are enabled and the keyboard acts as one would expect a normal keyboard to act.

## Outside of Stock Mode

When not in stock mode, there are several changes to the keymap.

- *Print Screen* becomes *F13*
- *Scroll Lock* becomes *F14*
- *Pause* becomes *F15*
- Chording the *A*,*S*, and *M* keys toggles the [Auto Shift](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_auto_shift) feature.
- Chording the *C* and *W* keys turns on the [Caps Word](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_caps_word) feature.
