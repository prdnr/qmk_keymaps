This is a keymap for a rev3 nyquist with the bottom row of the pcb removed.

The switches installed are *light blue Kailh chocs*.  These switches are linear, and actuate with 20Â±10gf.  The light blue switches are no longer made, with *pink* being their replacement.

This keymap leans on [combos](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo) a fair amount.
